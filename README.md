# DailySurfing

Welcome to the daily_surfing gem! This gem is designed for surfing enthusiasts who do not want to waste their time finding quick surfing forecasts for Florida's East Coast. Just run this gem and you can get an up-to-date 3-day forecast of the entire coast, or select one of four regions (North Florida, Central Florida, Palm Beach area or the Broward/Miami/Dade area). This will give you enough information to determine when and where your next surf will be.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'daily_surfing'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install daily_surfing

## Usage
